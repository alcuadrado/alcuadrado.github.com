<p>
    I'm a software developer and <a href="http://dc.uba.ar">computer
    sciences major</a> living in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</p>
<p>
    I've been consulting on PHP (yes, I admit it!) and frontend
    development for the past five years, but currently
    interested in system programming, research and my own projects.
    I can make exceptions for interesting stuff, though.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes I <a href="/blog">write</a>.
